# MusicRenamer
Tired of unshuffled music in your music folder? This is the tool for you!

## How does it work?
You give the program the path of the folder where 
your music files are. The program will add an index
number to the beginning of the song names. You will see
that all the files will have a random number.
So it makes your life easy when you need your songs numbered, and
it will scramble the order.
